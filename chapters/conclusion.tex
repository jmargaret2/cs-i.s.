\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}\label{conclusion}

This project resulted in the successful implementation of a modular synthesizer, in which both pure sound waveforms and MIDI signals are used as inputs. Within the timeframe available, we accomplished a set of minimal goals necessary for success. While this thesis project ends with a positive result, there are also multiple ways in which this synthesizer can be improved upon, or extended. To conclude, we review the necessary goals of this project, which we accomplished, in addition to the areas in which further research and development can be pursued.
