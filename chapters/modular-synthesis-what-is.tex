\section[Modular Synthesis: What Is It?]{Modular Synthesis: What Is It?}\label{modular-synth-what-is}

A modular synthesizer is a type of synthesize which is composed of separate modules for different functions. These modules, in a physical hardware synthesizer, would be connected together by the user to create a \say{patch}. The output from these modules would then be audio signals, voltages, or digital signals for various logical or timing conditions. Typically, these modules would include voltage-controlled oscillators, voltage-controlled filters, voltage-controlled amplifiers, and envelope generators.\footnote{The need for voltage-controlled modules was such that the modules would not receive sufficient power otherwise to properly function.} Within a virtual modular synthesizer, we have no need for these voltage-controlled modules. However, we still must \say{patch} these modules together in a linear sort of way, and decide the order in which the modules are applied to a digital signal. 

To do so, there is no set order. Virtual modules, unlike their physical counterparts, are easily able to be patched together in any order. Based on the order that the user changes the values of each module, the synthesizer itself will then change the audio output to align. It is user dependent on which module is triggered first. How the modular synthesizer makes these changes will be explained in the next chapter.
